# PowerShell-Profile

Powershell Profile is just here to prettifies your prompt and create a "unix-like" environment.

## Prerequisites
- git for windows (winget install Git.Git)
- PSColor powershell module (Install-Module PSColor)

## Installing
Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/aiola13/PowerShell-Profile.git

### PowerShell Profile Location
Open PowerShell
Type $profile

The $profile variable returns the profile for the current user in the current program (host). 

Usually
```
> $Home\[My ]Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
```

### Edit the PowerShell Profile
The profile is now created, allowing you to open and edit the PowerShell Profile. Again we are using the PowerShell command to open the profile file:

```
> ise $profile
```

### Execution Policy
To use the profile you will need to make sure you have set the Execution Policy to Remote Signed. Otherwise, you wonâ€™t be able to run the script when PowerShell opens. Make sure you run PowerShell with elevated permissions (admin mode) to change the execution policy:

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
# Set the ExecutionPolicy to RemoteSigned:
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
